When Corey’s text came through last night, it was the first I’d heard from him in months. I was at my computer, staring at a lone ant as it navigated the landscape of my big toe.

The ant moved in frantic, uncertain bursts, searching for food or maybe friends. It seemed confused by its solitude—or perhaps thrilled by its newfound freedom. I couldn't help but wonder why it was alone; ants are supposed to travel in armies. The fact that I was this invested in an ant’s social life was a clear sign I needed to get out of my apartment. I worried that after being cooped up with my mother for so long, I’d be just as lost once I stepped into the world again. *Left, right, inside, outside… where are my friends? Where is the food?*

Just as the ant disappeared into a crack in the floorboards, Corey’s messages lit up my screen.

*Meet me tomorrow morning at nine at the Pantem Press building, floor 14. I think we might have an offer.*

Months ago, I’d drawn a line: since we no longer slept together, the proper way for an agent to contact his author was through email. He hadn't gotten the memo. He also didn't ask about my mom, which didn't surprise me. His lack of interest in anything beyond his job and himself was why we were no longer together. Still, his indifference sparked an unreasonable irritation. He owed me nothing, but he could have at least pretended to care.

I didn’t text him back. Instead, I watched the crack in the wall where the ant had vanished. I wondered if it would find its colony inside, or if it was a born loner, like me.

It’s hard to pinpoint the source of my crippling aversion to other people, but if I had to guess, I’d say it stems from my own mother being terrified of me. "Terrified" might be too strong, but she certainly didn't trust me as a child. She kept me isolated, afraid of what I might do during one of my sleepwalking episodes. That fear seeped into my adult life, and by then, the damage was done. I was a loner with few friends and a nonexistent social life. Which is why this was the first time I’d left my apartment in weeks.

I always imagined my first trip back into the world would be to somewhere I missed, like Central Park or a quiet bookstore. I never thought I’d be standing in the lobby of a publishing house, praying that whatever offer this was would be enough to cover my rent and keep me from getting evicted. But here I am, one meeting away from homelessness or a lifeline.

I smooth down the front of the white shirt Jeremy lent me, hoping I don’t look completely ridiculous. Maybe I can pass it off as some new, oversized fashion statement.

"Nice shirt," a voice says from behind me.

I turn, startled to see Jeremy. *Is he following me?*

It’s my turn, so I hand my license to the security guard before looking back at him, noting he’s in a fresh shirt. "Do you carry spares in your pocket?" It hasn't been that long since he gave me his.

"My hotel is a block away," he explains. "I walked back to change."

A hotel. That's a good sign. It means he probably doesn't work in this building, and if he doesn't work here, maybe he isn't in publishing. For some reason, I hope he isn’t. After the morning we've had, I want this meeting to have nothing to do with him.

"So you don't work here?" I ask as he hands his own ID to the guard.

"No. I have a meeting on the fourteenth floor."

Of course he does.

"So do I," I say.

A faint smile touches his lips before vanishing, as if he’s just remembered the morning's horror and realizes it's too soon for levity. "What are the chances we’re heading to the same one?" he asks as we walk toward the elevators.

"I wouldn't know. They haven't told me why I'm here yet."

We step inside, and he presses the button for our floor. As the doors close, he pulls his tie from his pocket and begins looping it around his neck. I can't stop staring at his wedding ring.

"Are you a writer?" he asks.

I nod. "Are you?"

"No. My wife is." He tightens the knot on his tie. "Have you written anything I might know?"

"I doubt it. No one reads my books."

His lips curve up again. "There can't be that many authors named Lowen. I'm sure I could figure it out." He pulls out his phone and starts typing.

"I never said I write under my real name."

He doesn't look up until the elevator dings and the doors slide open. He steps into the doorway and turns, holding up his phone with a full, genuine smile. "You don't use a pen name. You write as Lowen Ashleigh. And funnily enough, that’s the author I have a meeting with at nine-thirty."

There's the smile I was curious about, and as stunning as it is, I don't want it anymore. He just Googled me. And while my meeting was for nine, it seems he knows more about it than I do. Our encounter on the street suddenly feels less coincidental, though I suppose it’s not impossible we’d witness the same accident on our way to the same building.

Jeremy steps aside to let me pass. "See you in a few," he says, already walking backward down the hall.

Despite knowing nothing about him, I can't help but like the man who literally gave me the shirt off his back. I manage a small smile before he turns the corner. "Alright. See you in a few."

He returns the smile. "Alright."

The moment he's gone, I lean against the wall, the tension of the morning finally hitting me. A man's death, a stranger's kindness, and now this. What the hell is happening?

"You're on time," Corey says, startling me. He walks up from the opposite direction and leans in to kiss my cheek. I stiffen. "You're never on time."

"I would have been here sooner, but—" I stop myself. He looks completely disinterested as he starts walking down the same hall Jeremy just took.

"The meeting isn't until nine-thirty," he says. "I told you nine because I figured you'd be late."

I freeze, staring at the back of his head. If he had told me the correct time, I wouldn't have been across the street. I wouldn't be covered in a dead man's blood. I swallow my irritation. With Corey, that’s a familiar reflex.

He leads me into an empty conference room, and I take a seat at the long table. He sits beside me, turning to face me. He looks the same as he always has—clean-cut, tailored, wearing a tie and a confident smile. A stark contrast to me.

"You look terrible," I say, because he looks perfect and he knows it.

"And you look refreshed and ravishing," he replies, because I always look tired and perpetually bored. I've heard of Resting Bitch Face; I have Resting Bored Face.

"How's your mother?"

"She died last week."

That throws him. He leans back, tilting his head. "Why didn't you tell me?"

*Why didn't you bother to ask?* "Still processing," I shrug. My mother had been living with me for the nine months since her diagnosis. She passed last Wednesday. For the last few months, she needed me for everything, and I couldn't leave the apartment. It’s funny how one of the most populated cities on earth can also be a paradise for agoraphobics; thanks to Wi-Fi and a credit card, you never have to leave your home.

"You okay?" Corey asks, his concern feeling like a formality.

"I'm fine," I lie. "It helps that it was expected." The truth is, I'm relieved she's gone. My mother brought nothing but guilt into my life.

Corey gets up and gestures to a counter lined with pastries and coffee. "Water's fine," I say. He brings two bottles over. "Do you need help with the will? Edward can handle it."

Edward is the agency’s lawyer. "Not necessary. All she left me was debt."

Corey purses his lips. He knows my financial situation better than anyone. "You have a foreign royalty check coming soon," he says, as if I haven't already budgeted every penny of it.

"I know. I'll be fine."

He straightens his tie, unconvinced. "Well, hopefully this offer will be good for both of us."

"Why are we meeting in person?" I ask, relieved to change the subject. "You know I hate this."

"They insisted. Said they have a job offer but wouldn't give details over the phone. We have to sign an NDA first."

"I thought you were getting me another contract with my last publisher."

"Your sales aren't cutting it anymore," he says bluntly. "To get another contract, you'd have to engage on social media, go on tour, build a fan base. You refuse to do any of that."

This was my biggest fear. The royalty checks have been dwindling, and I haven't written anything new in a year. "I have no idea what this is about," Corey continues, "but the secrecy has me intrigued. We need this." He says *we* because he gets fifteen percent.

Corey starts sweating, a sure sign he's nervous, which in turn makes me more nervous. "Let me do the talking," he says, clicking his pen. I was planning on it.

"What are you wearing?" he asks, finally noticing my clothes.

"Spilled coffee on my shirt," I lie. "This was in my closet. Probably yours."

"You left the house in that? It doesn't look very high fashion."

"No?" I ask sarcastically. "Is it supposed to?"

Before he can answer, the door opens. A woman with short black hair and jarringly red lipstick walks in, followed so closely by an older man that he bumps into her when she stops. "Goddammit, Barron," she mutters under her breath.

Jeremy enters last, giving me a subtle nod.

"Amanda Thomas," the woman says, shaking our hands. "I'm an editor here. This is Barron Stephens, our lawyer, and Jeremy Crawford, our client."

Jeremy and I shake hands, expertly pretending we’re strangers. He takes the seat across from me, and I find my eyes drawn to him, my curiosity about his presence overriding my interest in the meeting itself.

"I'll cut to the chase," Amanda says. "One of our authors is medically unable to fulfill her contract. We're looking for a writer in the same genre to complete the three remaining books in her series."

I glance at Jeremy. His expression is unreadable.

"Who's the author?" Corey asks. After we sign the NDAs, Amanda tells us.

"Verity Crawford."

Corey goes still. Everyone knows Verity Crawford. I look at Jeremy again. His wife. He said his wife was a writer.

"Verity has a very successful series we would hate to see go unfinished," Amanda says. "Our goal is to bring in a co-writer to finish the books and handle all the required press tours and publicity."

*Book tours? Press releases?*

Corey glances at me, knowing that's a deal-breaker. I'm so awkward with people that I'm convinced meeting me in person would make my readers swear off my books forever.

"What is Mrs. Crawford's compensation?" Goddammit Barron cuts in. "All royalties will go to Verity. However, my client, Jeremy Crawford, is prepared to offer a flat payment of seventy-five thousand dollars per book."

My stomach flips. That’s more money than I’ve ever seen. But the excitement dies as the reality of it sinks in. Going from a nobody to the co-author of a literary phenomenon is too big of a leap.

Corey leans forward. "I'm assuming the pay is negotiable."

I try to signal to him that it doesn't matter, but he ignores me. The conversation continues pointlessly until I finally clear my throat. "I appreciate the offer," I say, looking directly at Jeremy. "I really do. But if you need someone to be the new face of this series, I'm not the right person."

I stand, ready to go home.

"I'd like a moment with my client," Corey says quickly. Amanda and Barron agree to step out, promising to wait for our decision. Jeremy, however, remains seated, his gaze fixed on me. He hasn't said a word this whole time.

"Could we have a word in private?" he asks me, his tone a polite dismissal of Corey.

Corey shoots me a look that says, *Can you believe this guy?* But what he doesn't understand is that I'm desperate to be alone in this room with Jeremy. I have so many questions for him.

"It's fine," I tell Corey. His jaw tightens, but he leaves.

It’s just Jeremy and me. Again.

"Jesus," he mutters, running a hand down his face. "Are meetings with publishers always this stiff?"

I laugh quietly. "I wouldn't know. I do everything over email."

"I can see why." He stands and gets a bottle of water, and suddenly I feel small in his presence. "You okay? You didn't have much time to adjust after what happened."

"Neither did you."

"I'm alright," he says. "I'm sure you have questions."

"A ton," I admit. "Why can't your wife finish the series?"

"She was in a car accident," he says, his voice detached and mechanical. "I had hoped she would fully recover, but… here we are."

Now his quiet grief makes sense. It’s not just from the accident; it's from his daughter's death, too. This man is drowning. "I'm so sorry."

He just nods. "I appreciate the offer, Jeremy, but I'm not comfortable with the publicity. I don't even know why I was considered."

"Open Ended," he says, naming one of my books. "It was one of Verity's favorites. She said your writing styles were similar. I'm the one who gave your name to her editor. If anyone is going to take over this series, I want it to be someone whose work she respected."

I shake my head, stunned. "Wow. I'm flattered, but I can't."

He watches me, his eyes full of curiosity. He stands and walks over to a wall of framed awards, his back to me. He runs his fingers over one of them—one of his wife's.

"Have you ever heard of people being called 'Chronics'?" he asks without turning around. I shake my head. "I think Verity made it up. After our daughters died, she said we were prone to chronic tragedy. One terrible thing after another." He used the plural. *Daughters?*

He turns back to me, his composure cracking. "Yeah. Twins. We lost one six months before we lost the other. Some families are lucky. Others seem to have tragedies waiting on the back burner. What can go wrong, goes wrong. And then gets worse."

He seems to be talking more to himself than to me. It feels like he just wanted everyone else out of the room, and being alone with me feels, to him, like being alone. I find that strangely comforting.

"I grew up next to a man who lost his whole family in two years," I say quietly. "His son in combat, his wife to cancer, then his daughter in a car wreck."

Jeremy looks at me. "Where is he now?"

The truth is, the man killed himself. But saying that to Jeremy would be cruel. "He remarried," I lie. "Has a few stepkids and grandchildren now." He looks at me like he knows I'm lying, but appreciates the gesture.

"You'll need to spend time at our house, in Verity's office," he says, suddenly changing the subject. "She has years of notes, outlines... stuff I can't make sense of."

"Jeremy, I told you, I can't—"

"The lawyer is lowballing you," he cuts in, his voice firm. "Tell your agent to ask for half a million. Tell them you'll do it with no press, under a pen name, with an ironclad non-disclosure. That way, whatever it is you're trying to hide can stay hidden."

Before I can respond, he's at the door. "We live in Vermont. I'll give you the address after you sign. You can stay for as long as it takes." He pauses, his hand on the doorknob.

I open my mouth to object, but the only word that comes out is a shaky, "Alright."

He looks at me for a long moment, then nods. "Alright."

He opens the door and walks out. Corey immediately slips back in, closing it behind him. I stare at the table, my head spinning. Half a million dollars? With no publicity? What just happened?

"I don't like him," Corey says, dropping into his chair. "What did he say?"

"He said they're lowballing me and to ask for half a million with no press."

I turn just in time to see Corey choke on air. He grabs my water bottle and takes a desperate gulp. "Shit."
