In my early twenties, I had a boyfriend named Amos who liked to be choked.

That’s why we broke up—my refusal to do it. But sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I’d given in to his urges. Would we be married? Have children? Would he have graduated to even more dangerous fetishes? In your twenties, I feel like vanilla sex should be enough, at least for a while.

Thinking about Amos is my go-to coping mechanism for when I’m disappointed in the state of my life. As I stare at the pink eviction notice Corey is holding, I remind myself that things could always be worse. I could still be with Amos.

I open my apartment door wider to let Corey inside. If I’d known he was coming, I would have intercepted the notice first. It’s the third one this week. I snatch it from his hand and shove it in a drawer.

He holds up a bottle of champagne. “Thought we could celebrate the contract,” he says, and I’m grateful he doesn’t mention the eviction. It’s less of a threat now, with a paycheck on the horizon, but I’m still not sure what I’ll do for money until then. I can always pawn what’s left of my mother’s things.

Corey has already shed his coat and is loosening his tie. This was our old routine, before my mom moved in. He’d show up and start shedding layers of clothing until we were tangled together in my bed. That ended abruptly when I saw on social media that he was dating a girl named Rebecca. I didn’t stop sleeping with him out of jealousy; I stopped out of respect for her.

“How’s Becca?” I ask, pulling two glasses from the cabinet.

His hand freezes on his tie. “How do you—?”

“I write suspense novels, Corey. Don’t act so surprised that I know about your girlfriend.”

I pop the champagne and pour two glasses, handing one to him as he settles at the bar. We raise them, but I lower mine before he can make a toast. Staring into the bubbles, I realize the only thing to celebrate is the money.

“It feels wrong,” I say. “They aren’t my characters. The woman who created them is seriously injured. Toasting to this seems predatory.”

Corey’s glass hangs in the air for a moment before he shrugs, downs the entire flute in one go, and hands it back to me. “Don’t focus on why you’re in the game. Just focus on the finish line.”

I roll my eyes and start washing the dishes piled in the sink. I have forty-eight hours to get out of this apartment, and my plates are coming with me. “Have you ever even read one of her books?” I ask.

He laughs. “No. She’s not my style.” He catches himself a second too late, realizing he’s just insulted my writing, since Verity’s husband hired me precisely because our styles are supposedly so similar. “That’s not what I meant,” he says, moving to stand beside me. He takes a plate I’ve just scrubbed and starts rinsing it. “You haven’t packed. Have you found a new place?”

“I have a storage unit for my stuff. I’ve applied for a place in Brooklyn, but it won’t be ready for two weeks.”

“The notice says you have two days.”

“I’m aware.”

“So, a hotel?”

“Eventually. I’m leaving for Vermont on Sunday. Jeremy—Mr. Crawford—says I’ll need to go through his wife’s office before I can start writing.”

Corey stops rinsing, and I can feel his eyes on me. “You’re staying at their house?”

“How else am I supposed to get her notes?”

“Have him mail them.”

“There are thirteen years’ worth of outlines and research. He said he wouldn’t know where to begin sorting through it all.”

He’s quiet, but I can practically hear him biting his tongue. “What is it?” I ask.

He sets a knife in the drying rack and grips the edge of the sink, turning to face me. “The man lost two daughters. Now his wife is in a catastrophic accident. I’m not exactly comfortable with you staying in his house.”

The water suddenly feels ice-cold, and a chill runs down my arms. I turn it off and lean back against the counter. “Are you suggesting he was involved?”

Corey shrugs. “I don’t know enough to suggest anything. But the thought hasn’t crossed your mind? That maybe it isn’t safe? You don’t know these people.”

The thought had, of course, crossed my mind. I’d spent the afternoon digging into their history. The first daughter died from an allergic reaction at a sleepover fifteen miles away; Jeremy and Verity weren’t there. The second drowned in the lake behind their house, but Jeremy didn’t get home until after the search was underway. Both deaths were ruled tragic, unrelated accidents.

“And Verity’s car wreck?” Corey presses.

“She hit a tree.”

“I read there were no skid marks,” he says, his expression grim. “Which means she either fell asleep at the wheel or she did it on purpose.”

“Can you blame her?” I snap, irritated by his armchair detective work. “She lost both of her children. Anyone would want a way out after that.”

He grabs his jacket from the barstool. “Accident or not, that family has shit luck and a world of emotional damage. Be careful. Get in, get what you need, and get out.”

“You worry about the contract, Corey. I’ll handle the research.”

“I’m just looking out for you.”

He’s not looking out for me. He’s a spurned ex-boyfriend who thought he was going to get laid tonight, only to be politely rejected before finding out I’m going to be staying in another man’s home. He’s masking jealousy as concern.

I walk him to the door, relieved he’s leaving. I want out of this apartment as badly as he does; it’s been suffocating ever since my mother moved in.

“For what it’s worth,” he says, pausing in the doorway, “congratulations. Your writing got you this opportunity. You should be proud.”

I hate when he’s nice right when I’m most annoyed with him. “Thank you.”

“Text me when you get there Sunday.”

“I will.”

“And let me know if you need help moving.”

“I won’t.”

He laughs softly. “Okay, then.” He gives me an awkward salute as he backs away, and I close the door, feeling like our relationship has finally settled where it should have been all along: agent and author. Nothing more.
