I could've spent the six-hour drive so many other ways. I could've looped "Bohemian Rhapsody" more than sixty times, or finally called Natalie, my friend I hadn't properly spoken to in over half a year. We texted occasionally, but hearing her voice would have been a welcome change. Better yet, I could've used the time to mentally rehearse all the reasons I needed to keep a safe distance from Jeremy Crawford while staying in his home.

Instead, I chose to listen to the audiobook of Verity Crawford’s first novel.

The final words just faded out, leaving me gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles were white. My mouth was bone dry, and my self-esteem felt like it had been left somewhere back in Albany.

She was brilliant. Truly.

A wave of regret washed over me for signing the contract. How could I possibly measure up? And to think, she'd already penned six of these novels, all from the villain’s perspective. It was astounding—how could one person’s mind contain such a bottomless well of creativity? I tried to cling to the hope that the other five books were terrible, that there'd be low expectations for the three I had to finish. But who was I kidding? Every single one of Verity's novels was a bestseller, debuting at number one on the *Times* list.

My anxiety, which had been simmering since I left Manhattan, now reached a full boil. I spent the rest of the drive wanting to turn back, but I pushed on, reminding myself that self-doubt was just part of my writing process. For me, it was always the same three steps:

1.  **Start the book and hate every word.**
2.  **Keep writing the book despite hating every word.**
3.  **Finish the book and pretend I’m happy with it.**

I never reached a point where I felt I’d fully achieved my goal or written something truly worth reading. While other authors promoted their work with unshakeable confidence, I was the awkward one, posting a picture of my book with a caption like, "It's an okay book. There are words in it. Read it if you want."

I was terrified this project would be even worse. My own books didn't attract many readers, which meant fewer negative reviews. But attaching my name to Verity’s series meant hundreds of thousands of readers with high expectations. If I failed, Corey, the publishers, and Jeremy would know. And depending on her mental state, Verity herself might know.

Jeremy had been vague about her injuries, and the online articles were equally unhelpful, stating only that she’d suffered "non-life-threatening injuries." Two weeks ago, a publisher's statement said she was "recovering peacefully at home," but her editor, Amanda, mentioned they wanted to keep the details private, which made me think they were downplaying everything. Then again, after the tragedies this family had endured over the past two years, maybe she just didn’t want to write anymore.

It was understandable the publishers needed to protect their biggest source of income. And while I was honored to be chosen, the spotlight was the last thing I wanted. When I started writing, I only dreamed of making enough to pay my bills, not of fame or fortune. Very few authors reached that level of success, so I never had to worry about it.

I knew this opportunity would boost sales of my previous books and open doors for future projects, but Verity’s success was monumental. Taking over her series meant subjecting myself to the kind of attention I’d always feared. I wasn't after fifteen minutes of fame; I was after a paycheck.

The wait for the advance would be long. Most of my money had gone to renting this car and putting my belongings in storage. I'd paid a deposit on an apartment, but it wouldn't be ready for at least another week, maybe more, so whatever little I had left would have to cover a hotel after I left the Crawford home. It felt like rock bottom: a week and a half after losing my last immediate family member, I was essentially homeless, living out of a suitcase. But then I reminded myself, I could be married to Amos right now—it could always be worse.

"Jesus, Lowen," I muttered to myself, annoyed at my own self-pity. How many writers would kill for this opportunity, and here I was, feeling sorry for myself? Ungrateful, party of one. I had to stop seeing my life through my mother’s pessimistic lens. Once the advance came in, everything would be fine. I'd finally have a place to live.

A few miles back, I’d taken the exit for the Crawford estate. The GPS led me down a long, winding road flanked by flowering dogwood trees and houses that grew more palatial and secluded with every mile. When I reached the entrance, I pulled over to take it all in. Two towering brick columns marked the beginning of a seemingly endless driveway that disappeared into the dense trees. Somewhere up there was the house, and inside it was Verity Crawford. My palms began to sweat as I wondered if she knew I was coming. I lifted my hands from the wheel and held them in front of the air vents to dry.

The security gate was propped open, so I drove past the sturdy wrought iron, a shiver running down my spine as I noticed the repetitive pattern at the top resembled spiderwebs. The trees grew denser, the road curving until the house finally came into view. The roof, a slate gray like an angry storm cloud, appeared first, and then the rest of the dark stone structure emerged, broken only by the striking, blood-red front door—the only splash of color. Ivy crept up the left side of the house, not charmingly, but like a slow, creeping cancer.

I thought of my old apartment: the dingy walls, the tiny kitchen with the ugly olive-green fridge from the '70s. My entire living space would probably fit into this monster's entryway. My mother used to say houses have a soul. If that was true, the soul of Verity Crawford’s house was a darkness I couldn't comprehend.

The satellite images I'd "stalked" online didn't do the property justice. A realtor website said they’d bought it five years ago for two and a half million, and it was now worth over three. It was overwhelming, huge, and remote, yet it lacked the formal, stuffy atmosphere of similar homes. There wasn't an air of superiority clinging to the walls.

I drove slowly along the driveway, wondering where to park. The lawn was a pristine carpet of green, at least three acres deep, with a lake stretching behind the house. The Green Mountains provided a beautiful backdrop, making the family’s tragic story feel all the more jarring. I sighed in relief when I spotted a concrete parking area next to the garage and turned the engine off. My rental—a cheap Kia Soul, thirty bucks a day—felt laughably out of place next to what I knew was a Range Rover from the articles about her crash.

I reached for my phone on the passenger seat to text Corey that I'd arrived. As I put my hand on the driver's side door handle, I froze, my back stiffening. I turned to look out the window. "Shit!" I hissed, my hand flying to my chest to check for a heartbeat. What the hell? I stared at the face staring back at me, a child's face. I immediately covered my mouth, hoping he’d heard worse curse words. He didn't laugh; he just stared, which was somehow even more unnerving.

He was a miniature version of Jeremy, with the same mouth and green eyes. I remembered reading that Jeremy and Verity had three children. This must be their son. I opened the door, and he took a small step back. "Hey," I said. He didn't answer. "Do you live here?"

"Yes."

I looked at the house behind him. "Must be nice," I muttered under my breath.

"Used to be." He turned and walked toward the front door. I felt a pang of sympathy. I hadn't given much thought to what this family had been through. This little boy, no older than five, had lost both his sisters. And who knew what that grief had done to his mother? Jeremy's pain had been obvious.

I left my suitcase in the car and followed him. Just as I reached the porch, he opened the front door, went inside, and closed it in my face. I waited, wondering if he was playing a joke, but through the frosted glass, I could see his silhouette continue through the house. I didn't want to call a little kid an asshole, especially one who had been through so much, but I couldn't help but think he might be.

I rang the doorbell and waited. And waited. And waited. I rang again. No answer. I pulled up Jeremy’s contact from the email he’d sent and texted him: "*It's Lowen. I’m at your front door.*"

A few seconds later, I heard footsteps descending the stairs. I watched Jeremy's shadow grow larger behind the frosted glass. Just before he opened the door, I saw him pause, take a deep breath. It was a small gesture, but it reassured me that maybe I wasn't the only one nervous about this situation. It was strange, how his potential discomfort made me feel a little more at ease.

He opened the door, looking different from the man I'd met just a few days ago. Gone were the suit and tie, the air of mystery. He wore sweatpants and a blue Bananafish t-shirt, socks but no shoes. "Hey," he said.

I ignored the odd buzz I felt and smiled. "Hi."

He stared for a moment, then stepped aside. "Sorry, I was upstairs. I told Crew to get the door. Guess he didn’t hear me."

I stepped into the foyer. "You have a suitcase?" he asked.

"Yeah, in my back seat. I can get it later."

"Is the car unlocked?"

I nodded.

"I'll be right back." He slipped on a pair of shoes and walked outside. I spun around, surveying the space. It felt surreal; thanks to the realtor photos, I felt like I already knew my way around. The kitchen was to the right, the living room to the left, separated by a grand staircase. The kitchen had been updated from the dark cherry cabinets I’d seen online, now featuring lighter wood shelves and cabinets, two ovens, and a refrigerator with a glass door.

I was staring at the glass-front fridge when the little boy bounded down the stairs, opened it, and pulled out a Dr. Pepper. I watched him struggle to open it.

"Want me to open that for you?" I asked.

"Yes, please," he said, looking up at me with those big green eyes. His voice was so sweet, his hands so tiny. I instantly regretted thinking he was an asshole. I took the bottle from him and twisted the cap off with ease. As I handed it back to him, the front door opened, and Jeremy came inside carrying my suitcase.

He narrowed his eyes at his son. "I just told you, no sodas." He set my suitcase down and walked over, taking the bottle from the boy’s hands. "Go get ready for your shower. I'll be there in a minute."

Crew rolled his eyes and stomped back toward the stairs.

Jeremy raised an eyebrow. "Never trust that kid. He's smarter than both of us put together." He took a sip of the soda before putting it back in the fridge. "You want anything to drink?"

"No, I'm fine."

He picked up my suitcase and carried it down the hallway. "I hope it's not weird, but I'm giving you the master bedroom. We all sleep upstairs now, and it's the closest room to her office."

"I'm not even sure I’m staying the night," I said, following him. The eerie atmosphere made me want to get what I needed and find a hotel. "I was just planning to check out the office and assess the situation."

He laughed. "Trust me, you'll need at least two days. Maybe more." He pushed open a door, placed my suitcase on a chest at the foot of the bed, and pointed to an empty section of the closet. "I made some space in case you need to hang anything." He gestured toward the bathroom. "It's all yours. Let me know if you need toiletries. We probably have them."

"Thank you." It felt bizarre, standing here in their master bedroom, potentially sleeping in their bed. My gaze was drawn to the headboard, where teeth marks were bitten into the wood. I quickly looked away, hoping Jeremy hadn't caught my stare. I wondered which of them had to bite the headboard to keep quiet during sex. Had I ever had sex that intense?

"Need a minute, or do you want to see the rest of the house?" Jeremy asked.

"I'm good," I said, following him into the hallway. But I paused at the bedroom door. "Does this door lock?"

He stepped back in, jiggling the handle. "I don't know that we've ever locked it." He looked at me. "I can find a lock if it's important to you."

I hadn’t slept in a room without a lock since I was ten. I wanted to beg him, but I didn’t want to be more of an imposition than I already was. "No, it’s fine."

He let go of the door. "Before I take you upstairs, have you thought of a pen name?"

The thought hadn’t crossed my mind since Pantem agreed to my demands. I shrugged. "Not really."

"I'd like to introduce you to Verity's nurse using a pen name. Just in case you never want anyone associating you with the series." Her injuries were bad enough she needed a live-in nurse?

"Okay. I guess..." I was still drawing a blank.

"What street did you grow up on?" Jeremy asked.

"Laura Lane."

"First pet's name?"

"Chase. He was a Yorkie."

"Laura Chase," he said. "I like it."

I tilted my head, recognizing the pattern. "Isn't that how people figure out their porn star name?"

He laughed. "Pen name, porn star name. Works across the board." He motioned for me to follow. "Let’s meet Verity, then I’ll take you to her office."

He took the stairs two at a time. I saw a new elevator near the kitchen—Verity must be in a wheelchair. God, the poor woman. Jeremy waited for me at the top of the stairs, then turned left down the hallway. "This is Crew's room," he said, pointing to the first door. "I sleep in that room." He pointed to the next one. Across the hall, another door was shut. He tapped on it gently and pushed it open.

I wasn't prepared for what I saw. She was lying on her back, staring at the ceiling, her blonde hair fanned out on the pillow. A nurse in blue scrubs was putting socks on her feet. Crew was on the bed next to his mother, holding an iPad. Verity's eyes were vacant, showing no awareness of the nurse, of me, of Crew, or of Jeremy as he leaned over to brush her hair from her forehead. She blinked, but there was no spark of recognition. I tried to hide the chills that ran up my arms.

The nurse, a woman in her mid-fifties with short red hair, addressed Jeremy. "She seemed tired, so I thought I’d put her to bed early." She pulled a blanket over Verity.

Jeremy closed the curtains. "Did she take her after-dinner meds?"

"Yeah, she's good until midnight," the nurse said. She glanced at me, then at Jeremy, waiting for an introduction.

Jeremy looked surprised, as if he’d forgotten I was there. "This is Laura Chase, the author I was telling you about. Laura, this is April, Verity's nurse."

I shook April's hand, feeling her judgmental gaze. "I thought you'd be older," she said, her tone a subtle jab. I ignored it and smiled. "It's good to meet you, April."

"You too." She grabbed her purse and turned back to Jeremy. "I’ll see you in the morning. Should be an easy night." She reached down and pinched Crew’s thigh. He giggled and scooted away. I stepped aside as she left the room.

I looked at Verity. Her eyes were still open, connected to nothing. She didn't seem to notice the nurse had left. Was she aware of anything? I felt terrible for everyone: Crew, Jeremy, and Verity. I didn't know if I'd want to live in this condition. The thought of Jeremy tied to this life, the tragedies, the struggles—it was all so depressing.

"Crew, I told you to take a shower."

Crew looked at his father and smiled, but didn't move.

"I’m gonna count to three."

Crew set his iPad down but still didn't get off the bed.

"Three... two..." At the count of one, Jeremy lunged, grabbing his son’s ankles and hoisting him upside down. "Upside down night it is!"

Crew shrieked with laughter. "Not again!"

Jeremy looked at me. "Laura, how many seconds can a kid hang upside down before their brain flips and they start talking backward?"

I laughed at their playful banter. "I heard twenty seconds. But it could be fifteen."

"No, Daddy, I'll go shower!" Crew cried. "I don't want my brain to be upside down!"

"And will you clean out your ears? Because they clearly weren't working before when I told you to take a shower."

"I swear!"

Jeremy turned him right side up, put him back on his feet, and ruffled his hair. "Go."

I watched Crew scamper out of the room and into his bedroom across the hall. The interaction made the house feel a little more inviting. "He's cute. How old is he?"

"Five," Jeremy said. He went back into Verity's room, raised her hospital bed slightly, and turned on the TV with a remote. We both exited, and he pulled the door mostly shut. In the hallway, he sighed, his hands sliding into his sweatpants pockets. He looked back at Verity’s door, as if he wanted to explain more but couldn't find the words.

"Crew was scared to sleep up here by himself. He's been a trooper, but the nights are rough for him. He wanted to be closer to her, but he didn't like sleeping downstairs. I moved us both up here to make it easier on him." He walked back down the hallway, flipping off the lights. "Which means you have the run of the downstairs at night." He stopped at the bottom of the stairs. "Want to see her office?"

"Of course."

I followed him to the double doors near the stairwell. When he opened one, I felt like I was trespassing, rummaging through the most intimate part of his wife’s life. 

The room was lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, every crevice filled with books. Boxes of papers were stacked along the walls. And her desk... My God, her desk. It stretched the length of one wall, lined with enormous windows overlooking the entire backyard. Not an inch of the surface was visible beneath the mountains of papers and files.

"She’s not the most organized person," Jeremy said.

I smiled, feeling a kinship with Verity. "Most writers aren't."

"It's going to take time. I would try to organize it myself, but it's all Greek to me."

I walked to a bookshelf and ran my hand over the spines, foreign editions of her work. I pulled a German copy from the shelf and examined it.

"She has a laptop and a desktop," Jeremy said. "I wrote the passwords on sticky notes for you." He picked up a notebook. "She was constantly taking notes, writing down her thoughts. Ideas on napkins, dialogue on a waterproof notepad in the shower." He put the notebook back down. "One time, we were at the zoo and she didn't have a notepad, so she wrote character names on the bottom of Crew’s diaper with a Sharpie." He did a slow, full circle, looking around the room as if he hadn't been in here in years. "The world was her manuscript. No surface was safe."

My heart warmed at the way he appreciated her creative process. I spun in a circle, taking it all in. "I had no idea what I was getting into."

"I didn't want to laugh when you said you might not need to stay the night, but honestly, this might take you more than two days. If it does, you're welcome to stay as long as you need. I'd rather you take your time and make sure you have everything you need than go back to New York unsure of how to tackle this."

I looked at the shelves holding the series. Nine books in total. Six had been published; three remained. The series, *The Noble Virtues,* had books named after different virtues. The final three I was to write were *Courage*, *Truth*, and *Honor*. All six published books were on the shelf, and I was relieved to see extras. I pulled out the second novel and skimmed it.

"Have you read the series yet?" Jeremy asked.

I shook my head, not wanting to admit I'd listened to the audiobook and risk him asking questions. "I haven’t. Didn’t have time between signing the contract and coming here." I put the book back. "Which is your favorite?"

"I haven’t read any of them, not since her first book."

"Really?" I looked at him in surprise.

"I didn’t like being inside her head," he said.

I held back a smile; he sounded a lot like my ex, Corey, who couldn’t separate an author’s work from their real life. But at least Jeremy seemed more self-aware.

I looked around the room, feeling overwhelmed. Was it because Jeremy was standing there, or because of the chaos I was about to sort through? "I don't even know where to start."

"Yeah, I'll let you get to that." He pointed to the door. "I should probably check on Crew. Make yourself at home. Food, drinks... the house is yours."

"Thank you."

Jeremy closed the door, and I sat down in Verity’s desk chair, which probably cost more than a month’s rent at my old apartment. I wondered how much easier writing was for someone who had money to burn on things I’d only dreamed of: comfortable furniture, an on-call masseuse, more than one computer. I imagined it would make the process so much less stressful. My own laptop had a missing key, my internet was stolen from a neighbor, and my desk was a cheap folding table from Amazon. Most of the time, I couldn't even afford printer ink.

I guess being here for a few days would be a good test of my theory: the richer you are, the more creative you can be.

I pulled the second book from the shelf, intending to only glance at how she transitioned from the first. Three hours later, I hadn’t moved. Chapter after chapter of intriguing, truly messed-up characters. It would take time to get into that mindset. No wonder Jeremy didn't read her work—all her books were from the villain's perspective. I really should have read them all before coming here.

I stood up to stretch, but my body didn't even hurt; this chair was the most comfortable piece of furniture I'd ever sat in. I looked around, deciding whether to start with her computer files or the physical ones. I went with her desktop first, browsing her Microsoft Word files. They were all related to her published books, nothing about what was to come. Her laptop had the same files.

Maybe she hand-wrote her outlines. I turned my attention to the boxes near a closet, covered in a thin layer of dust. I sifted through several, finding various manuscript drafts, all of her published work. But in the sixth box, I found a manuscript with an unfamiliar title: *So Be It*. I flipped through the first few pages, hoping it was an outline for the seventh book, but it was immediately clear it wasn’t. It felt... personal. I looked at the first page of chapter one. "I sometimes think back on the night I met Jeremy and wonder, had we not made eye contact, would my life still end the same?"

Jeremy’s name. It was an autobiography. It wasn't what I was looking for, not what the publishers were paying me for, but I couldn't resist. I looked over my shoulder to make sure the door was shut. This was research, I told myself. I needed to understand her mind as a writer. I carried the manuscript to the couch, made myself comfortable, and began to read.
