I hear the crack of his skull a split second before the spray of blood hits me.

Gasping, I stumble back onto the sidewalk. My heel catches the curb, and I grab a "No Parking" sign to keep from falling.

Just moments ago, the man had been standing right in front of me. We were part of a crowd waiting for the light to change when he stepped into the street without looking, right into the path of an oncoming truck. I had lunged to pull him back, my fingers closing on empty air as he went down. I shut my eyes just before the tire went over his head, but I still heard it pop like a champagne cork.

It was his own fault, really. He was glancing down at his phone, a casual act born from crossing this same street hundreds of times without a problem. Death by routine.

A few people gasp, but no one screams. A passenger jumps out of the truck, immediately kneeling beside the body. As others rush forward to help, I back away. I don't need to look to know he didn't survive. A glance at my once-white shirt, now splattered with crimson, tells me a hearse would be more useful than an ambulance.

I turn to get away from the scene, to find a place where I can breathe, but the crosswalk sign flashes WALK. The crowd surges forward, making it impossible for me to move against the current. Some people don't even look up from their phones as they stream past the accident. I give up trying to fight it and wait for the throng to thin. When I look back, I’m careful to avoid looking directly at the body. The truck driver is at the back of his vehicle, wide-eyed and talking on his phone. Three or four people are helping, while a few others, driven by morbid curiosity, are filming the gruesome scene.

If this had happened back in Virginia, the reaction would have been completely different. Everyone would have stopped. There would have been panic, screaming, and a news crew on-site within minutes. But this is Manhattan, where a pedestrian getting hit by a car is little more than an inconvenience—a traffic delay for some, a ruined shirt for me. An incident like this probably happens too often here to even make the local news.

As much as the city's indifference disturbs me, it’s the very reason I moved here ten years ago. People like me thrive in overcrowded places where personal stories get lost in the noise. In a city this large, the state of my own life is irrelevant.

Here, I’m invisible. Unimportant. Manhattan is too busy to give a damn about me, and for that, I love her.

"Are you hurt?"

I look up to see a man touching my arm. Deep concern is etched on his face as he scans my blood-splattered shirt, checking me for injuries. His reaction tells me he’s not one of the hardened New Yorkers; wherever he came from, it was a place that didn't manage to beat all the empathy out of him.

"Are you hurt?" he asks again, this time looking me directly in the eye.

"No," I say, my voice trembling slightly. "It's not my blood. I was standing right next to him when…" I trail off. A man just died so close to me that I’m wearing his blood.

I came to this city to be invisible, not impenetrable. I’ve been trying to become as hard as the concrete beneath my feet, but it’s not working. The full weight of what I just witnessed is beginning to settle in my stomach.

I raise a hand to cover my mouth but pull it away when I feel something sticky on my lips. More blood. I look down at my shirt, pulling the fabric away from my chest where it’s starting to dry and stick to my skin.

I need some water. I’m feeling light-headed and want to rub my forehead, but I’m afraid to touch my own face. I look up at the man who is still holding my arm.

"Is it on my face?" I ask.

He presses his lips together and glances around before gesturing to a coffee shop a few doors down. "They'll have a bathroom," he says, placing a hand on the small of my back and guiding me toward it.

Across the street, I see the Pantem Press building—my destination. I was so close, maybe twenty feet from a meeting I couldn't afford to miss. I can't help but wonder how far the man who just died was from his.

The stranger holds the door open for me at the coffee shop. A woman with two coffees tries to squeeze past me, then recoils when she sees my shirt, scurrying back to let us enter. I head for the women's restroom, but it’s locked. The man pushes open the door to the men’s room and motions for me to go in.

He leaves the door unlocked as he walks to the sink and turns on the water. I look in the mirror, relieved that my face isn't as bad as I'd imagined. There are a few dark, drying specks on my cheeks and a small spray of red above my eyebrows. My shirt took the worst of it.

He hands me a wet paper towel, and I begin to wipe my face. The metallic tang of blood now fills the air, and for a moment, I’m ten years old again, overwhelmed by a smell I haven't forgotten in all these years. Nausea rises in my throat. I need to get this shirt off me. Now.

With trembling fingers, I unbutton it and hold it under the running water. While the faucet runs, I use another wet towel to clean the blood from my chest.

The stranger moves toward the door, but not to leave. He locks it, giving me privacy while I stand there in my worn-out bra. The gesture is so disturbingly chivalrous that it puts me on edge. I watch his reflection in the mirror, tense.

Someone knocks.

"Be right out," he calls.

I relax slightly, knowing someone is just outside the door.

I focus on my task, washing away every last trace of blood from my neck and chest. I check my hair next, but there’s nothing but an inch of dark roots showing through my faded caramel color.

"Here," the man says, unfastening the last button on his own crisp, white shirt. "Put this on."

He has already taken off his suit jacket and hung it on the doorknob. He shrugs off his button-up, revealing a white undershirt. He’s tall and muscular; his shirt will swallow me whole. It's a ridiculous outfit for the meeting I’m late for, but I have no other choice. I take the shirt, pat my skin dry with a paper towel, and pull it on. It looks absurd, but at least it wasn't my skull that exploded onto a stranger's clothes. Silver lining.

I wring out my ruined shirt and toss it in the trash. Gripping the edge of the sink, I stare at my reflection. Two tired, empty eyes stare back, the hazel darkened to a murky brown by the horror they’ve just seen. I look like death.

Leaning against the wall, I turn away from the mirror. The man is rolling up his tie and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He studies me for a moment. "I can’t tell if you’re calm or in shock."

"I'm not sure," I admit. "Are you okay?"

"I’m fine," he says. "Unfortunately, I’ve seen worse."

I tilt my head, trying to understand his cryptic remark. He avoids my gaze, which only makes me more curious. What could be worse than watching a man's head get crushed by a truck? Maybe he’s a native New Yorker after all. Or a doctor. He has an air of competence, the kind that comes with being in charge.

"Are you a doctor?"

He shakes his head. "Real estate. Or I was." He steps closer and brushes something off the shoulder of his shirt—my new shirt. As he drops his arm, his eyes linger on my face for a moment before he steps back.

His eyes are the same chartreuse green as the tie he just put away. He’s handsome, but in a way that seems to inconvenience him, as if he wants to hide that part of himself. He wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me.

Most people move to New York to be seen. The rest of us come here to disappear.

"What's your name?" he asks.

"Lowen."

He pauses for a fraction of a second after I say my name. "Jeremy," he replies, turning back to the sink to wash his hands. My curiosity gets the better of me.

"What did you mean, you've seen worse?" I ask his reflection.

He turns off the water, dries his hands, and faces me. "You really want to know?"

I nod.

He tosses the paper towel in the trash and shoves his hands in his pockets. His expression darkens even more. He's looking at me, but he seems disconnected from the moment. "Five months ago, I pulled my eight-year-old daughter’s body out of a lake."

The air rushes out of my lungs. I press my hand to my throat. It wasn't gloom in his eyes; it was despair. "I'm so sorry," I whisper, ashamed of my curiosity.

"What about you?" he asks. He leans against the counter, as if this is a conversation he’s been waiting for, a chance to find someone whose tragedy might lessen his own. It's what people do when they’ve hit rock bottom—they look for others who are worse off to feel better about their own suffering.

I swallow hard. My tragedies feel insignificant compared to his. "My mother died last week."

He doesn't react the way I did. He shows no emotion at all, and I wonder if he was hoping my story was worse. It isn’t. He wins.

"How?" he asks.

"Cancer. I spent the last year taking care of her in my apartment." The words hang in the air; it's the first time I've said it out loud to anyone. I feel my pulse throb in my wrist and clamp my other hand around it. "Today is my first day out in weeks."

We stand in silence for a moment. I want the conversation to end, but I don’t know how to stop it. Where do you possibly go from here?

It turns out, you go nowhere. He turns back to the mirror, pushes a stray lock of dark hair into place, and says, "I have a meeting to get to. Are you sure you'll be okay?"

"Yes. I'm alright."

"Alright?" he repeats the word as a question, as if it isn't quite the reassurance he was looking for.

"I'll be alright," I say again. "Thank you for your help."

I wish he would smile, but the moment doesn't call for it. He gives a small shrug. "Alright, then." He unlocks the door and holds it open, but I hesitate, not quite ready to face the world again. I want to thank him properly, maybe offer to buy him a coffee or return his shirt. I find myself drawn to his kindness, a rare quality these days. But then I see the flash of a wedding ring on his left hand, and it propels me forward, out of the bathroom and back onto the crowded street.

An ambulance has arrived, blocking traffic. I walk back toward the scene and give my statement to a police officer, though I’m not sure how helpful it is since I didn’t see the actual impact. I was just close enough to hear it, to be painted by it.

I glance back and see Jeremy leaving the coffee shop with a fresh cup in his hand. He crosses the street, his mind already somewhere else, far away from me. He’s probably thinking about his wife and how he’ll explain his missing shirt when he gets home.

I pull out my phone. I still have fifteen minutes before my meeting at Pantem Press. My hands are shaking worse now that the distraction is gone. Coffee might help. Morphine would be better, but hospice cleared out all my mother's medication last week. It’s a shame I was too distraught to think of hiding some. I could really use it right now.
