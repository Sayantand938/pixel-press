Before I continue with the discussion between Caroline and myself, it seems necessary to outline the local geography and the key players in our small village of King's Abbot. Our town is not unlike any other rural community. Nine miles away lies Cranchester, our nearest city. We have a sizable railway station, a small post office, and two competing general stores. While many of our young men leave to seek their fortunes, we are rich in spinsters and retired military officers. The primary occupation here can be summed up in a single word: gossip.

Only two houses of real consequence stand in King's Abbot. The first is King's Paddock, inherited by Mrs. Ferrars from her late husband. The second, Fernly Park, belongs to Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always fascinated me; he is a man who seems to be a more perfect caricature of a country squire than any real squire could ever be. He brings to mind the red-faced sportsmen who, in old-fashioned musical comedies, would appear on the village green in the first act, singing a song about their upcoming trip to London. These days, with the rise of revues, the country squire has faded from the theatrical stage.

Of course, Ackroyd isn't a true country squire. He is the immensely successful manufacturer of—I believe—wagon wheels. Approaching fifty, he has a ruddy complexion and a perpetually cheerful demeanor. He's on excellent terms with the vicar, donates generously to parish funds (though rumors suggest he's personally quite frugal), and enthusiastically supports cricket matches, Lads' Clubs, and Disabled Soldiers' Institutes. In short, he is the life and soul of our peaceful King's Abbot.

When Roger Ackroyd was just twenty-one, he fell in love with and married a beautiful woman about five or six years his senior. Her name was Paton, a widow with a young son. Their marriage was brief and difficult. To be blunt, Mrs. Ackroyd was a dipsomaniac, who drank herself into an early grave just four years after their wedding.

In the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no inclination to remarry. His wife’s son from her first marriage was only seven when his mother died. Now twenty-five, Ralph Paton has always been treated by Ackroyd as his own, yet he's been a wild youth, a constant source of worry and trouble for his stepfather. Still, we are all quite fond of Ralph Paton here in King's Abbot. For one thing, he's a remarkably good-looking young man.

As I mentioned before, we in this village are always ready for a good bit of gossip. From the beginning, everyone noticed that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got along splendidly. After her husband's death, their intimacy became even more pronounced. They were always seen together, and it was widely speculated that once her mourning period was over, Mrs. Ferrars would become the next Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It seemed, in a way, a fitting outcome. Roger Ackroyd’s first wife had died from drink, and Ashley Ferrars had been an alcoholic for years before his own death. It seemed only right that these two victims of alcoholic excess should find solace in each other's company, making up for the suffering their previous spouses had caused them.

The Ferrars had only lived here for a little over a year, but a cloud of gossip has hung over Ackroyd for many years. Throughout Ralph Paton's upbringing, a series of lady housekeepers presided over Ackroyd's household, and each, in turn, was eyed with great suspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It’s no exaggeration to say that for at least fifteen years, the village has been certain that Ackroyd would eventually marry one of them. The latest, a formidable woman named Miss Russell, has reigned supreme for five years—twice as long as any of her predecessors. It was believed that had Mrs. Ferrars not arrived, Ackroyd could not have escaped his destiny. That, and one other factor: the unexpected arrival of his widowed sister-in-law and her daughter from Canada. Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, the widow of Ackroyd’s ne’er-do-well younger brother, has taken up residence at Fernley Park and has, according to Caroline, succeeded in putting Miss Russell in her "proper place."

I'm not exactly sure what a "proper place" entails—it sounds cold and unpleasant—but I have noticed that Miss Russell now goes about with pinched lips and a distinctly acidic smile. She professes the utmost sympathy for "poor Mrs. Ackroyd," who is "dependent on her husband's brother’s charity. The bread of charity is so bitter, isn't it? I would be quite miserable if I didn't work for my living."

I have no idea what Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Mrs. Ferrars affair when it began. It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd remain unmarried. She was always very charming—not to say gushing—whenever they met. Caroline, however, insists that proves nothing.

These have been our preoccupations in King's Abbot for the past few years. We have debated Ackroyd and his affairs from every angle. Mrs. Ferrars had seamlessly found her place in our little drama. But now, the kaleidoscope has been shaken. From a mild debate over wedding presents, we have been thrust into the heart of a tragedy.

As I revolved these thoughts in my mind, I continued my medical rounds on autopilot. I had no particularly interesting cases to attend to, which was probably for the best, as my mind kept returning to the mystery of Mrs. Ferrars’s death. Did she take her own life? Surely, if she had, she would have left some message explaining her actions. In my experience, once women decide to commit suicide, they usually want to justify their fatal act. They crave the spotlight.

When had I last seen her? It had been over a week ago. At that time, her manner had seemed normal enough, considering... well, considering everything. Then I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though we didn't speak, just yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had been surprised because I had no idea he was in King's Abbot. I had thought he had finally quarreled with his stepfather. He hadn’t been seen here for nearly six months. They were walking side-by-side, their heads close together, and she was speaking very intently.

I can confidently say that it was in that moment that a sense of foreboding first washed over me. Nothing concrete yet—just a vague premonition about how things were aligning. That intense private conversation between Ralph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars the day before struck me as deeply unsettling.

I was still thinking about it when I came face-to-face with Roger Ackroyd.

"Sheppard!" he exclaimed. "The very man I wanted to find. This is a terrible business."

"You've heard, then?"

He nodded. I could see the news had hit him hard. His large, ruddy cheeks seemed to have caved in, and he looked a wreck compared to his usual jovial, healthy self.

"It's worse than you know," he said quietly. "Listen, Sheppard, I have to talk to you. Can you come back to the house with me now?"

"I'm afraid not. I still have three patients to see, and I need to be back by noon for my surgery hours."

"Then this afternoon—no, better yet, dine with me tonight. At 7:30. Will that work?"

"Yes, that's fine. What's wrong? Is it Ralph?"

I wasn't sure why I asked that—except, perhaps, it had so often been about Ralph in the past.

Ackroyd stared at me blankly, as if he didn't quite understand. I began to realize something was very, very wrong. I had never seen him this shaken before.

"Ralph?" he repeated vaguely. "Oh, no, it's not Ralph. Ralph's in London—Blast it! Here comes old Miss Gannett. I don't want to have to talk to her about this ghastly business. See you tonight, Sheppard. 7:30."

I nodded, and he hurried away, leaving me to wonder. Ralph in London? But he had most certainly been in King's Abbot the previous afternoon. He must have returned to the city last night or this morning, yet Ackroyd's manner suggested otherwise. He had spoken as if Ralph hadn't been in the area for months.

I didn't have time to ponder the matter further. Miss Gannett was upon me, desperate for information. Miss Gannett has all the characteristics of my sister Caroline, but she lacks that unerring instinct for jumping to the right conclusions, which gives Caroline's maneuvers a touch of brilliance. Miss Gannett was breathless and full of questions.

Wasn't it so sad about poor Mrs. Ferrars? A lot of people were saying she had been a drug addict for years. It was so awful how people spread such things, and yet, the worst part was there was always a grain of truth in those wild statements. Where there's smoke, there's fire! They were also saying that Mr. Ackroyd had found out about it and broken off their engagement—because there *was* an engagement. She, Miss Gannett, had positive proof. Of course, *I* must know all about it—doctors always do—but they never tell, do they?

All the while, her sharp, beady eyes watched my every reaction. Fortunately, years of practice with Caroline have taught me to maintain a blank expression and have a supply of noncommittal remarks ready. This time, I congratulated Miss Gannett on her refusal to join in ill-natured gossip. It was a rather neat counterattack, I thought. It put her in an awkward position, and before she could recover, I had moved on.

I went home deep in thought, to find several patients waiting for me in my surgery.

I thought I had seen the last of them and was just about to spend a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I noticed one more patient waiting. She rose and approached me as I stood there, somewhat taken aback.

I don't know why I was surprised, except that Miss Russell has an aura of cast iron about her, a suggestion that she is above the usual ailments of the body.

Ackroyd’s housekeeper is a tall woman, handsome but with a forbidding appearance. She has a stern gaze and lips that are always tightly shut, and I feel that if I were a housemaid, I would run for my life whenever I heard her coming.

"Good morning, Dr. Sheppard," Miss Russell said. "I would be very grateful if you could take a look at my knee."

I examined it, but frankly, I was no wiser after I did. Miss Russell's description of vague pains was so unconvincing that with a woman of lesser integrity, I would have suspected a feigned illness. For a moment, it did cross my mind that she might have invented the knee problem to try and pry information out of me about Mrs. Ferrars's death. But I soon realized I had misjudged her on that front. She made only a brief reference to the tragedy and nothing more. Yet, she seemed determined to linger and chat.

"Well, thank you very much for this bottle of liniment, Doctor," she said at last. "Not that I believe it will do the slightest bit of good."

I didn’t think it would, either, but I protested as a matter of professional duty. After all, it couldn't do any harm, and one must stand up for the tools of one's trade.

"I don't believe in all these drugs," Miss Russell said, her eyes sweeping disparagingly over my row of bottles. "Drugs do a lot of harm. Look at the cocaine habit."

"Well, as far as that goes..."

"It's very common in high society."

I'm quite sure Miss Russell knows far more about high society than I do. I didn't try to argue with her.

"Just tell me this, Doctor," Miss Russell continued. "If you are truly a slave to the drug habit, is there any cure?"

One cannot answer a question like that off the cuff. I gave her a short lecture on the topic, and she listened with intense focus. I still suspected her of trying to glean information about Mrs. Ferrars.

"Now, Veronal, for example..." I began.

But, strangely, she didn't seem interested in Veronal. Instead, she changed the subject, asking me if it was true that certain poisons are so rare they can't be detected.

"Ah," I said. "You've been reading detective stories."

She admitted that she had.

"The essence of a good detective story," I said, "is to have a rare poison—if possible, something from South America that no one has ever heard of—something that a single, obscure tribe of savages uses to poison their arrows. The death is instantaneous, and Western science is powerless to detect it. Is that what you mean?"

"Yes. Does such a thing really exist?"

I shook my head regretfully. "I'm afraid not. There's curare, of course."

I told her quite a bit about curare, but she seemed to have lost interest again. She asked if I kept any in my poison cupboard, and when I said no, I felt I had fallen in her estimation.

She said she needed to get back, and I saw her out the surgery door just as the luncheon gong rang.

I would never have suspected Miss Russell of having a fondness for detective stories. It amuses me to imagine her, after stepping out of the housekeeper's room to reprimand a disobedient maid, returning to the comfort of her chair to read *The Mystery of the Seventh Death* or something of the sort.
