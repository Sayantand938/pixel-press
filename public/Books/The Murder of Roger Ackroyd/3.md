At lunch, I informed Caroline that I would be dining at Fernly. Far from objecting, she seemed pleased.

"Excellent," she said. "You'll hear all about it. By the way, what’s going on with Ralph?"

"With Ralph?" I replied, surprised. "There isn't anything wrong."

"Then why is he staying at the Three Boars instead of at Fernly Park?"

I didn't question Caroline’s statement for a second. The fact that she said Ralph Paton was at our local inn was enough for me.

"Ackroyd told me he was in London," I said. In my surprise, I had broken my cardinal rule of never giving Caroline information.

"Oh!" Caroline’s nose twitched as she began to process this new detail. "He arrived at the Three Boars yesterday morning," she continued. "And he's still there. Last night he was out with a girl."

That didn't surprise me at all. Ralph, I would say, is out with a girl most nights. What did puzzle me was that he had chosen to pursue this pastime in King's Abbot rather than in the glamorous city of London.

"One of the barmaids?" I asked.

"No, that's the thing. He went out to meet her. I don't know who she is."

This was a bitter admission for Caroline to make.

"But I can guess," my indefatigable sister went on.

I waited patiently.

"His cousin."

"Flora Ackroyd?" I exclaimed in surprise.

Flora Ackroyd, of course, isn't actually related to Ralph Paton by blood, but since he has been considered Ackroyd's son for so long, their cousinship is taken for granted.

"Flora Ackroyd," my sister confirmed.

"But if he wanted to see her, why not just go to Fernly?"

"Secretly engaged," Caroline said with immense satisfaction. "Old Ackroyd won't hear of it, so they have to meet in this way."

I could see several flaws in Caroline’s theory, but I decided to spare her the details. Instead, I diverted the conversation by making an innocent remark about our new neighbor.

The house next door, The Larches, had recently been leased by a stranger. To Caroline’s extreme annoyance, she had been unable to uncover a single fact about him, other than that he was a foreigner. Her vaunted intelligence corps had proven useless. The man, presumably, had milk, vegetables, meat, and fish delivered just like everyone else, yet none of the tradespeople who supplied these goods had managed to gather any information. His name, apparently, was Mr. Porrott—a name that struck me as decidedly odd. The only thing we knew about him was his interest in growing vegetable marrows.

But that was certainly not the kind of information Caroline was after. She wanted to know where he came from, what he did for a living, whether he was married, what his wife was—or had been—like, if he had children, and what his mother's maiden name was. I think someone very much like Caroline must have invented the questions on passports.

"My dear Caroline," I said. "There's no doubt at all about his profession. He’s a retired hairdresser. Just look at that mustache of his."

Caroline disagreed. She said that if the man were a hairdresser, he would have wavy hair—all hairdressers did. I cited several hairdressers I knew who had straight hair, but she remained unconvinced.

"I can't figure him out at all," she said in an aggrieved voice. "I borrowed some gardening tools the other day, and he was extremely polite, but I couldn't get a thing out of him. I finally asked him point-blank if he was a Frenchman, and he said no. And somehow, I didn't feel I could ask anything more."

I began to feel more intrigued by our mysterious neighbor. A man who could shut down Caroline and send her away empty-handed, like the Queen of Sheba, must be a person of some note.

"I believe," Caroline said, "that he has one of those new vacuum cleaners..."

I saw the prospect of a borrowed appliance and another opportunity for questioning shining in her eyes. I took my chance and escaped into the garden. I am quite fond of gardening. I was diligently pulling up dandelions when a warning shout rang out from nearby, and a heavy object whizzed past my ear, landing at my feet with a repulsive squelch. It was a vegetable marrow.

I looked up angrily. Over the garden wall to my left, a face appeared: an egg-shaped head partially covered with suspiciously black hair, an enormous mustache, and a pair of alert, watchful eyes. It was our mysterious neighbor, Mr. Porrott.

He immediately launched into a torrent of fluent apologies. "I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense. For some months now, I have cultivated the marrows. But this morning, suddenly, I enrage myself with these marrows. I send them to promenade themselves—alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself."

Faced with such an abundance of apologies, my anger was forced to dissipate. After all, the wretched vegetable hadn't hit me. Still, I sincerely hoped that throwing large vegetables over walls was not a habit of our new friend. It would hardly make him a good neighbor.

The strange little man seemed to read my thoughts. "Ah! No," he exclaimed. "Do not be troubled. It is not a habit with me. But can you imagine, monsieur, that a man may work toward a certain goal, may toil and labor to achieve a certain kind of leisure and an occupation, only to find that, after all, he yearns for the old busy days and the old work he thought he was so glad to leave?"

"Yes," I said slowly. "I imagine that's a common enough feeling. I am perhaps an example myself. A year ago, I came into a legacy—enough to allow me to fulfill a dream. I have always wanted to travel, to see the world. Well, that was a year ago, as I said, and... I am still here."

My little neighbor nodded. "The chains of habit. We work to achieve an objective, and when the object is gained, we find that what we miss is the daily toil. And mind you, monsieur, my work was interesting work. The most interesting work in the world."

"Yes?" I said, encouragingly. For a moment, the spirit of Caroline was strong within me.

"The study of human nature, monsieur!"

"Precisely," I said kindly. He was clearly a retired hairdresser. Who knows the secrets of human nature better than a hairdresser?

"Also, I had a friend—a friend who for many years never left my side. At times, his foolishness could make one afraid, yet he was very dear to me. Imagine, I miss even his stupidity. His naiveté, his honest outlook, the pleasure of delighting and surprising him with my superior gifts—all these I miss more than I can say."

"Did he die?" I asked sympathetically.

"Not at all. He lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world. He is now in Argentina."

"In Argentina," I said, a little enviously. I have always wanted to go to South America. I sighed, then looked up to find Mr. Porrott watching me with sympathy. He seemed a remarkably understanding little man.

"Will you go there, then?" he asked.

I shook my head with a sigh. "I could have gone," I said. "A year ago. But I was foolish—and worse than foolish—greedy. I risked the substance for the shadow."

"I understand," said Mr. Porrott. "You speculated?"

I nodded mournfully, but in spite of myself, I felt a secret amusement. This ridiculous little man was so profoundly solemn.

"Not the Porcupine Oilfields?" he asked suddenly.

I stared. "As a matter of fact, I did consider them, but in the end, I chose a gold mine in Western Australia."

My neighbor was regarding me with a strange expression I couldn't quite fathom.

"It is Fate," he said at last.

"What is Fate?" I asked, irritated.

"That I should live next to a man who seriously considered the Porcupine Oilfields and also West Australian Gold Mines. Tell me, do you also have a penchant for auburn hair?"

I stared at him with my mouth agape, and he burst out laughing.

"No, no, I am not mad. Rest easy. It was a foolish question, for you see, my friend I spoke of was a young man, a man who thought all women were good and most of them beautiful. But you are a man of middle age, a doctor, a man who knows the folly and vanity of most things in this life of ours. Well, well, we are neighbors. I beg you to accept and present to your excellent sister my best marrow."

He bent down and with a flourish produced an immense vegetable, which I accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.

"Indeed," the little man said cheerfully, "this has not been a wasted morning. I have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways resembles my friend far away. By the way, I would like to ask you a question. You doubtless know everyone in this tiny village. Who is the young man with the very dark hair and eyes and the handsome face? He walks with his head thrown back and an easy smile on his lips."

The description left me with no doubt. "That must be Captain Ralph Paton," I said slowly.

"I have not seen him around here before?"

"No, he hasn't been here for some time. But he is the son—adopted son, rather—of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park."

My neighbor made a slight gesture of impatience. "Of course, I should have guessed. Mr. Ackroyd spoke of him many times."

"You know Mr. Ackroyd?" I said, a little surprised.

"Mr. Ackroyd knew me in London—when I was at work there. I have asked him not to mention my profession here."

"I see," I said, amused by what I perceived as blatant snobbery.

But the little man went on with an almost grandiose smirk. "One prefers to remain incognito. I am not eager for notoriety. I have not even bothered to correct the local pronunciation of my name."

"Indeed," I said, not quite knowing what else to say.

"Captain Ralph Paton," Mr. Porrott mused. "And so he is engaged to Mr. Ackroyd's niece, the charming Miss Flora."

"Who told you that?" I asked, very surprised.

"Mr. Ackroyd. About a week ago. He is very pleased about it—he has long wished for this to happen, or so I understood from him. I even believe he put some pressure on the young man. That is never wise. A young man should marry to please himself, not to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations."

My assumptions were completely overturned. I couldn't imagine Ackroyd taking a hairdresser into his confidence and discussing the marriage of his niece and stepson. Ackroyd extends a genial, paternalistic attitude to the lower classes, but he has a very strong sense of his own dignity. I began to think that Porrott couldn't be a hairdresser after all.

To hide my confusion, I said the first thing that came to my mind. "What made you notice Ralph Paton? His good looks?"

"No, not that alone—though he is unusually handsome for an Englishman—what your lady novelists would call a Greek God. No, there was something about that young man that I did not understand."

He said the last sentence in a musing tone that left an indefinable impression on me. It was as though he was summing up the young man based on some inner knowledge that I didn't share. This impression lingered as my sister's voice called me from the house.

I went inside. Caroline had her hat on and had evidently just returned from the village. She began without preamble.

"I met Mr. Ackroyd."

"Yes?" I said.

"I stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry and very anxious to get away."

I had no doubt that this was the case. He would have felt about Caroline much as he had felt about Miss Gannett earlier—perhaps even more so. Caroline is less easy to shake off.

"I asked him at once about Ralph. He was absolutely astonished. He had no idea the boy was down here. He actually said I must have made a mistake. Me! A mistake!"

"Ridiculous," I said. "He ought to have known you better."

"Then he went on to tell me that Ralph and Flora are engaged."

"I knew that, too," I interrupted with modest pride.

"Who told you?"

"Our new neighbor."

Caroline visibly wavered for a moment or two, like a roulette ball hovering coyly between two numbers. But then she refused the tempting red herring. "I told Mr. Ackroyd that Ralph was staying at the Three Boars."

"Caroline," I said, "do you ever think that you might do a lot of harm with this habit of indiscriminately repeating everything you hear?"

"Nonsense," my sister replied. "People ought to know things. I consider it my duty to tell them. Mr. Ackroyd was very grateful to me."

"Well?" I said, knowing there was more to come.

"I think he went straight to the Three Boars, but if so, he didn't find Ralph there."

"No?"

"No. Because as I was coming back through the wood..."

"Coming back through the wood?" I interrupted.

Caroline had the decency to blush. "It was such a beautiful day," she exclaimed. "I thought I'd take a little detour. The woods with their autumnal colors are so perfect this time of year."

Caroline doesn't care for woods at any time of year. Normally, she regards them as places where you get your feet wet and where all kinds of unpleasant things might fall on your head. No, it was pure, unadulterated mongoose instinct that led her to our local woods. It's the only place near King's Abbot where you can have a conversation with a young woman without being seen by the entire village. It also adjoins Fernly Park.

"Well," I said, "go on."

"As I was saying, I was just coming back through the wood when I heard voices."

Caroline paused.

"Yes?"

"One was Ralph Paton's—I knew it at once. The other was a girl's. Of course, I didn't mean to listen..."

"Of course not," I interjected, my sarcasm lost on Caroline.

"But I simply couldn't help overhearing. The girl said something—I didn't quite catch what it was, and Ralph answered. He sounded very angry. 'My dear girl,' he said. 'Don't you realize there's a good chance the old man will cut me off without a penny? He's been pretty fed up with me for the last few years. A little more would do it. And we need the money, my dear. I'll be a very rich man when the old fellow kicks the bucket. He's as stingy as they come, but he's rolling in money. I don't want him to go and change his will. You leave it to me, and don't worry.' Those were his exact words. I remember them perfectly. Unfortunately, I stepped on a dry twig or something, and they lowered their voices and moved away. I couldn't, of course, go chasing after them, so I wasn't able to see who the girl was."

"That must have been terribly annoying," I said. "I suppose you hurried on to the Three Boars, felt faint, and went into the bar for a glass of brandy, so you could check if both the barmaids were on duty?"

"It wasn't a barmaid," Caroline said without hesitation. "In fact, I'm almost sure it was Flora Ackroyd, only..."

"Only it doesn't make any sense," I agreed.

"But if it wasn't Flora, who could it have been?"

My sister quickly rattled off a list of every unmarried woman in the area, providing elaborate reasons for and against each one. When she finally paused for breath, I mumbled something about a patient and slipped out.

My plan was to make my way to the Three Boars. It seemed likely that Ralph Paton would have returned by now.

I knew Ralph very well—perhaps better than anyone else in King's Abbot, since I had known his mother before him. Because of this, I understood much about him that perplexed others. He was, to a certain extent, a victim of his heredity. While he had not inherited his mother's fatal weakness for drink, he had a strain of instability. As my new friend from the morning had said, he was exceptionally handsome. Just under six feet, perfectly proportioned, and with the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark like his mother, with a tanned, handsome face always ready to break into a smile. Ralph Paton was one of those people born to charm effortlessly. He was self-indulgent and extravagant, with no respect for anything on earth, but he was lovable nonetheless, and his friends were devoted to him.

Could I do anything to help the boy? I thought I could.

When I inquired at the Three Boars, I was told that Captain Paton had just come in. I went up to his room and entered without knocking. For a moment, remembering what I had heard and seen, I was unsure how he would receive me, but I needn't have worried.

"Why, it's Sheppard! Glad to see you." He came forward to greet me, hand outstretched, a warm smile lighting up his face. "The one person I'm glad to see in this wretched place."

I raised my eyebrows. "What's the place been doing?"

He gave a frustrated laugh. "It’s a long story. Things haven't been going well for me, Doctor. But have a drink, won't you?"

"Thanks," I said. "I will."

He pressed the bell, then returned to throw himself into a chair. "To be blunt," he said gloomily, "I'm in a hell of a mess. In fact, I haven't the slightest idea what to do next."

"What's the trouble?" I asked sympathetically.

"It's my blasted stepfather."

"What has he done?"

"It’s not what he's done yet, but what he's likely to do."

The drinks were brought, and once the man had left, Ralph sat hunched in the armchair, frowning to himself.

"Is it really... serious?" I asked.

He nodded. "I'm truly up against it this time," he said soberly.

The unusual note of gravity in his voice told me he was speaking the truth. It took a lot to make Ralph serious. "In fact," he continued, "I just can't see my way ahead. I'm damned if I can."

"If I could help..." I offered diffidently.

But he shook his head with firm resolve. "Good of you, Doctor. But I can't let you in on this. I have to play a lone hand."

He was silent for a moment, then repeated in a slightly different tone, "Yes—I have to play a lone hand."
