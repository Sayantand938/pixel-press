Mrs. Ferrars passed away in the early hours of September 17th, a Thursday night. At eight o'clock the following morning, a Friday, I was summoned. By the time I arrived, there was nothing to be done; she had been gone for hours.

It was just after nine when I returned home. I let myself in with my latchkey and deliberately lingered in the hallway, taking my time to hang up my hat and the light overcoat I had brought as a precaution against the early autumn chill. The truth is, I felt profoundly unsettled and uneasy. I won't claim that I could foresee the dramatic events of the coming weeks, for I absolutely did not. But my intuition, nonetheless, warned me that I was on the brink of tumultuous times.

From the dining room to my left, the faint clatter of teacups was audible, punctuated by the short, dry cough of my sister, Caroline.

"Is that you, James?" she called out.

An unnecessary question, of course, as there was no one else it could possibly be. But it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my brief delay. The motto of the mongoose family, as Mr. Kipling so aptly puts it, is, "Go and find out." If Caroline were ever to adopt a crest, I would certainly suggest a mongoose rampant. We could, however, omit the first half of the motto. Caroline possesses an extraordinary ability to find things out while sitting placidly at home. I have no idea how she does it, but it is an undeniable fact. My suspicion is that the servants and local tradesmen act as her personal intelligence corps. When she does venture out, it isn't to gather information but to disseminate it, a task at which she is uncannily expert.

It was this latter trait that was causing my pangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline about Mrs. Ferrars's death would, within ninety minutes, become the village's common knowledge. As a professional man, I am bound by discretion. Consequently, I have made a habit of withholding all possible information from my sister. She usually uncovers the truth anyway, but at least I have the moral satisfaction of knowing the blame is not on me.

Mrs. Ferrars's husband had died just over a year ago, and Caroline had relentlessly—and without a shred of evidence—asserted that his wife had poisoned him. She consistently scoffed at my professional diagnosis that Mr. Ferrars died of acute gastritis, exacerbated by his habitual overindulgence in alcohol. While the symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are indeed similar, Caroline based her accusation on entirely different grounds.

"You only have to look at her," I had heard her say on more than one occasion.

Mrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was an elegant and attractive woman whose simple, well-tailored clothes seemed to fit her perfectly. Yet many women purchase their clothes in Paris, and that fact alone does not imply they've murdered their husbands.

As I stood there, hesitating in the hall, my thoughts racing, Caroline's voice cut through again, this time with a sharper edge.

"James, what on earth are you doing out there? Come and get your breakfast."

"Just coming, my dear," I replied, a touch too quickly. "I was hanging up my overcoat."

"You could have hung up six overcoats in that amount of time," she retorted.

She was absolutely right. I could have.

I entered the dining room, gave Caroline the customary peck on her cheek, and sat down to my breakfast of eggs and bacon. The bacon, I noted, was rather cold.

"You had an early call," Caroline remarked.

"Yes," I said. "King's Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars."

"I know," my sister stated.

"How could you possibly know?" I asked.

"Annie told me."

Annie is our housemaid—a lovely girl, but an inveterate gossip.

There was a silence as I continued to eat my eggs and bacon. My sister's long, thin nose quivered slightly at its tip, a sure sign of her deep interest or excitement.

"Well?" she pressed.

"A sad business. Nothing to be done. She must have died in her sleep."

"I know," my sister said again.

This time, my annoyance flared. "You can't possibly know," I snapped. "I didn't know myself until I got there, and I haven't mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she must be a clairvoyant."

"It wasn't Annie who told me," she explained. "It was the milkman. He heard it from the Ferrars's cook."

As I said, Caroline has no need to leave the house to gather information. She sits at home, and the world comes to her.

My sister continued, "What did she die of? Heart failure?"

"Didn't the milkman tell you that as well?" I inquired, dripping with sarcasm.

Sarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes everything literally and responds in kind.

"He didn't know," she explained.

I realized Caroline would hear the full story sooner or later. She might as well hear it from me.

"She died from an overdose of Veronal. She's been taking it recently for sleeplessness. She must have taken too much."

"Nonsense," Caroline said immediately. "She took it on purpose. Don't try to tell me otherwise!"

It's a peculiar phenomenon: when you hold a secret belief you don't wish to admit, having someone else voice it can provoke an intense fury of denial. I erupted into an indignant speech.

"There you go again," I said. "Rushing to conclusions without any rhyme or reason. Why would Mrs. Ferrars want to commit suicide? She was a widow, still relatively young, quite wealthy, in good health, with nothing to do but enjoy her life. It's absurd."

"Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she's seemed lately. It's been going on for the last six months. She looked positively hag-ridden. And you just admitted she couldn't sleep."

"What's your diagnosis?" I asked coldly. "An unfortunate love affair, I presume?"

My sister shook her head.

"Remorse," she declared with great gusto.

"Remorse?"

"Yes. You never believed me when I said she poisoned her husband. Now I'm more convinced than ever."

"I don't think you're being very logical," I countered. "Surely if a woman committed a crime like murder, she'd be cold-blooded enough to enjoy the fruits of it without any of that weak-minded sentimentality like repentance."

Caroline shook her head. "There may be women like that—but Mrs. Ferrars wasn't one of them. She was a bundle of nerves. An overwhelming impulse must have driven her to get rid of her husband because she was the kind of person who simply cannot endure any form of suffering, and there's no doubt that the wife of a man like Ashley Ferrars would have had to suffer a great deal."

I nodded.

"And ever since, she's been haunted by what she did. I can't help feeling sorry for her."

I don't believe Caroline ever felt an ounce of pity for Mrs. Ferrars while she was alive. Now that she's gone to a place where, presumably, Parisian frocks are no longer an option, Caroline is willing to indulge in the softer emotions of compassion and understanding.

I firmly insisted that her entire theory was nonsense. I was all the more firm because I secretly agreed with at least some of what she had said. But it simply wasn't right that Caroline should stumble upon the truth through some form of inspired guesswork. I wasn't going to encourage that kind of behavior. She would go around the village airing her views, and everyone would assume she was doing so based on medical information I had provided. Life, I thought, is truly trying.

"Nonsense," Caroline said in response to my reprimands. "You'll see. Ten to one, she's left a letter confessing everything."

"She didn't leave a letter of any kind," I said sharply, not realizing the admission would box me into a corner.

"Oh!" Caroline exclaimed. "So you did inquire about that, did you? I believe, James, that in your heart of hearts, you think exactly as I do. You're a precious old humbug."

"One always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration," I said with an air of professional gravitas.

"Will there be an inquest?"

"That depends. If I can declare myself absolutely satisfied that the overdose was accidental, an inquest could be avoided."

"And are you absolutely satisfied?" my sister asked, her tone shrewd and knowing.

I did not answer but simply rose from the table.
